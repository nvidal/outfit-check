      "critique": "The dress leans into the 2026 trend of elevated casual wear, but the fabric appears slightly flimsy and the tie closure cheapens the overall look. While wrap dresses are timeless, the execution here lacks the precision tailoring seen on recent runways showcasing similar silhouettes.",
      "improvement_tip": "Opt for a higher quality natural fiber like linen or silk for a more luxurious drape. Consider a hidden closure for a cleaner, more sophisticated line.",
